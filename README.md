# NumPy Reshape Helper with Zero Padding

This is a beginner Python project that helps reshape NumPy arrays using custom user input.  
If the reshaped array size needs more elements, the script automatically adds zeros at the end to fill it.

## ðŸ§  Why I Made This

While learning NumPy, I realized that `.reshape()` throws an error if the number of elements doesnâ€™t match the target shape.  
So I wrote this project to fix that by padding with zeros and practicing NumPy and Python input handling.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Takes number of elements from the user
- Accepts element values
- Lets user choose rows and columns for reshaping
- Adds zeros if needed to make reshaping possible
- Displays the final array with shape

## ðŸ›  What I Learned

- Using NumPy for dynamic array creation
- Input validation and logic for reshaping
- Thinking like a problem solver, not just following tutorials

## ðŸ‘¶ Beginner Note

This is one of my early projects â€” it's written fully by me and reflects how I think through code.  
It may not be perfect, but itâ€™s real and part of my learning journey.
